# Use Case Diagram Documentation  

## Objective  
The objective of this document is to visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.  

## Instructions  

1. **Understand the Features**  
    Refer to the features outlined in Task 1 to identify the key functionalities of the system. These include:  
    - User registration  
    - Property booking  
    - Payments  

2. **Create the Use Case Diagram**  
    Use [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to design a use case diagram that captures the interactions between users and the system.  

3. **Key Elements to Include**  
    - **Actors**: Identify all key actors, such as users, administrators, and external systems.  
    - **Use Cases**: Represent the main functionalities, including user registration, property booking, and payments.  
    - **Relationships**: Clearly define the interactions and relationships between actors and use cases.  

4. **Ensure Completeness**  
    Verify that all critical interactions and functionalities are represented in the diagram.  

## Tools  
- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)  

## Deliverable  
A comprehensive use case diagram that effectively visualizes the interactions between users and the system for the specified functionalities.  

## Example Diagram  
Below is an example structure for your use case diagram:  

```
[User] ---> (User Registration)  
[User] ---> (Property Booking)  
[User] ---> (Payments)  
```  

Ensure your diagram is detailed and includes all relevant actors and interactions.
