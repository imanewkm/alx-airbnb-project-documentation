# README

## Objective

The purpose of this document is to map the workflow and processes of the backend features for the ALX Airbnb project. This will help in visualizing the steps and data flow, making it easier to understand and optimize the backend operations.

## Instructions

1. **Select a Backend Process**  
    Choose one of the key backend processes, such as:
    - User Registration
    - Property Booking
    - Payment Processing
    - Review and Rating System

2. **Design a Flowchart**  
    Use [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a flowchart that visualizes the steps and data flow for the selected process. Ensure the flowchart includes:
    - Key steps in the process
    - Decision points
    - Input and output data
    - Interactions with external systems or databases

3. **Save and Document**  
    - Save the flowchart as a `.drawio` file and export it as an image (e.g., `.png` or `.svg`).
    - Include the exported image in this directory for reference.
    - Update this README to describe the flowchart and its purpose.

## Example

If you choose **User Registration**, your flowchart might include:
- Input: User details (e.g., name, email, password)
- Validation: Check for existing users, validate input data
- Database Interaction: Save user details to the database
- Output: Confirmation message or error response

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new flowcharts for other backend processes.
- Improving existing flowcharts for clarity and accuracy.
- Updating this documentation to reflect changes.

## Tools

- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) for creating flowcharts.
