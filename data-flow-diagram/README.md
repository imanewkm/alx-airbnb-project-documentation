# Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Documentation

## Objective
The purpose of this document is to outline the creation of a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that maps the flow of data within the system. This diagram will provide a visual representation of how data moves between various entities, processes, and storage components.

## Key Entities
The DFD will include the following key entities:
- **Users**: Represents individuals interacting with the system (e.g., hosts and guests).
- **Properties**: Represents property listings managed by hosts.
- **Bookings**: Represents reservation details for properties.
- **Payments**: Represents payment transactions for bookings.

## Instructions
1. **Identify Features and Functionalities**:
    - Refer to the features and functionalities outlined in Task 1 to ensure all core backend operations are represented.

2. **Design the DFD**:
    - Use [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or a similar tool to create the diagram.
    - Include the following components:
      - **Data Inputs**: Information provided by users (e.g., property details, booking requests).
      - **Processes**: Backend operations (e.g., user authentication, booking validation, payment processing).
      - **Data Outputs**: Results of processes (e.g., booking confirmations, payment receipts).

3. **Structure the DFD**:
    - Use standard DFD notations:
      - **Circles** for processes.
      - **Arrows** for data flow.
      - **Rectangles** for external entities.
      - **Open-ended rectangles** for data stores.

4. **Ensure Completeness**:
    - Verify that all data flows are accounted for and accurately represent the system's operations.

## Deliverable
The final DFD should clearly illustrate:
- How data is input into the system.
- The processes that manipulate the data.
- The outputs generated by the system.
- The interaction between entities, processes, and data stores.

## Tools
- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (recommended for creating the DFD).

## Notes
- Ensure the DFD is easy to understand and follows standard conventions.
- Use descriptive labels for all entities, processes, and data flows.

## Example
Below is an example structure for the DFD:
1. **User** → Inputs booking request → **Booking Process** → Stores in **Booking Data Store**.
2. **Payment Process** → Outputs payment receipt → **User**.

---
By following these instructions, you will create a comprehensive DFD that effectively maps the data flow within the system.
