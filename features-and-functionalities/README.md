# Airbnb Clone Backend Documentation  

## üéØ Objective  
The goal of this project is to build a scalable, secure, and robust backend system for an Airbnb Clone. This document outlines the key features, technical requirements, and non-functional requirements necessary for the development process.  

## üìö Introduction  
Backend development is the backbone of any web application, handling server-side logic, database management, and API integrations. This documentation focuses on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, ensuring the system is functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

## üîë Core Functionalities  

### 1. User Management  
- **User Registration**:  
    - Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.  
    - Use secure authentication methods like JWT.  
- **User Login and Authentication**:  
    - Implement login via email and password.  
    - Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).  
- **Profile Management**:  
    - Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.  

### 2. Property Listings Management  
- **Add Listings**:  
    - Hosts can create property listings with details like title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.  
- **Edit/Delete Listings**:  
    - Hosts can update or remove their property listings.  

### 3. Search and Filtering  
- Implement search functionality to filter properties by:  
    - Location  
    - Price range  
    - Number of guests  
    - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)  
- Include pagination for large datasets.  

### 4. Booking Management  
- **Booking Creation**:  
    - Guests can book properties for specified dates.  
    - Prevent double bookings using date validation.  
- **Booking Cancellation**:  
    - Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.  
- **Booking Status**:  
    - Track statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.  

### 5. Payment Integration  
- Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:  
    - Upfront payments by guests.  
    - Automatic payouts to hosts after booking completion.  
- Support multiple currencies.  

### 6. Reviews and Ratings  
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
- Hosts can respond to reviews.  
- Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.  

### 7. Notifications System  
- Implement email and in-app notifications for:  
    - Booking confirmations  
    - Cancellations  
    - Payment updates  

### 8. Admin Dashboard  
- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:  
    - Users  
    - Listings  
    - Bookings  
    - Payments

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements  

### 1. Database Management  
- Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.  
- Required tables:  
    - Users (guests and hosts)  
    - Properties  
    - Bookings  
    - Reviews  
    - Payments  

### 2. API Development  
- Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.  
- Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:  
    - GET (retrieve data)  
    - POST (create data)  
    - PUT/PATCH (update data)  
    - DELETE (remove data)  
- Optionally use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios.  

### 3. Authentication and Authorization  
- Use JWT for secure user sessions.  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:  
    - Guests  
    - Hosts  
    - Admins  

### 4. File Storage  
- Store property images and user profile photos in file storage solutions.  

### 5. Third-Party Services  
- Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.  

### 6. Error Handling and Logging  
- Implement global error handling for APIs.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements  

### 1. Scalability  
- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.  
- Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.  

### 2. Security  
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.  
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.  

### 3. Performance Optimization  
- Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).  
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.  

### 4. Testing  
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like `pytest`.  
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
